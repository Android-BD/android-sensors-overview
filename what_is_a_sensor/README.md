# What is a Sensor?

A **sensor** is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The specific input could be *light*, *heat*, *motion*, *moisture*, *pressure*, or any one of a great number of other environmental phenomena. The output is generally a signal that is converted to human-readable display at the sensor location or transmitted electronically over a network for reading or further processing.
