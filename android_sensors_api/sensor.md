# Sensor

[`Sensor`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor.html) represents a hardware sensor on a device.

* Interesting public methods:
  * `getMaximumRange()` returns the maximum range the sensor can measure in the regular units reported by the sensor. 
  * `getResolution()` reports the resolution of the sensor, in the regular units reported by the sensor.
