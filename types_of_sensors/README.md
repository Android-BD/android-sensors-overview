# Types of Sensors

The Android platform supports three broad categories of sensors:

* **Motion sensors**
These sensors measure acceleration forces and rotational forces along three axes. This category includes accelerometers, gravity sensors, gyroscopes, and rotational vector sensors.
* **Environmental sensors**
These sensors measure various environmental parameters, such as ambient air temperature and pressure, illumination, and humidity. This category includes barometers, photometers, and thermometers.
* **Position sensors**
These sensors measure the physical position of a device. This category includes orientation sensors and magnetometers.

>**Note**: **Location Sensors** will not be studied in this overview.
